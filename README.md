# Bad C++ Rock Paper Scissors


This program lets you play rock paper scissors against the computer. Why? Why not? Is it good? No. Is it fun? Only as fun as real life. Does it have any cool and creative features? Definitely not.


This exists because I was bored and I slammed this program out in like 15 minutes.
